**Here is a complete list of every Cloudera and Steven Matison resource used or referenced in this chat:**

### 1. Main GitHub Repository (Core Setup)
- **Repository**: [https://github.com/cldr-steven-matison/ClouderaStreamingOperators](https://github.com/cldr-steven-matison/ClouderaStreamingOperators)  
  Full Cloudera Streaming Operators deployment (NiFi 2.x on Kubernetes) that you are running.

### 2. Blog Posts (Custom Processors & RAG Guidance)
- **Custom Processors with Cloudera Streaming Operators**  
  [https://cldr-steven-matison.github.io/blog/Custom-Processors-With-Cloudera-Streaming-Operators/](https://cldr-steven-matison.github.io/blog/Custom-Processors-With-Cloudera-Streaming-Operators/)  
  (Explains Python processor deployment, mount setup, and `nifi-cluster-30-nifi2x-python.yaml` pattern.)

- **RAG with Cloudera Streaming Operators**  
  [https://cldr-steven-matison.github.io/blog/RAG-with-Cloudera-Streaming-Operators/](https://cldr-steven-matison.github.io/blog/RAG-with-Cloudera-Streaming-Operators/)  
  (Your existing RAG flow with Kafka → chunking → TEI embedding server → vector DB.)

### 3. Processor Code Examples (Used as Reference for Class Structure)
- **NiFi2-Processor-Playground**  
  [https://github.com/cldr-steven-matison/NiFi2-Processor-Playground/tree/main/nifi-custom-processors](https://github.com/cldr-steven-matison/NiFi2-Processor-Playground/tree/main/nifi-custom-processors)  
  (Working Python processor examples like `TransactionGenerator.py` / `NewTransactionGenerator.py` that the `PutOpenSearchVector` and `QueryOpenSearchVector` code was patterned after.)

These are the **only** Cloudera/Steven Matison resources referenced or used to build the plan, processor code, and integration steps in this conversation. No additional external Cloudera documentation or other repos were pulled in.

You can copy-paste this list directly if needed. Let me know if you want it exported in another format (e.g., Markdown table or bullet list with descriptions).
